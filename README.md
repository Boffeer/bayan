# Bayan.js

Declarative Accordion maker

## How to use

Just make element with `.bayan` class and magic will be done
The first child element of `.bayan` becomes top part
The second child element of `.bayan` becomes bottom part

The first and the second element don't need any special class. You can use any you want

The third and other elements will not be touched

If there is no `.bayan` elements on page, then nothing works. Plugin works automaticaly and you don't have to init it
You can style top and bottom part as you want
